## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Contributing Guidelines
We welcome contributions from students, teaching assistants, and collaborators.

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch.  
- Use clear commit messages (e.g., `lab6a-wgcna-add-demo`).  
- Submit a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch.  
- Each PR must include:
  - Brief description of changes.  
  - Lab/test files updated if relevant.  
  - Clear authorship attribution.  

**Pair work is encouraged: contributions may be co-authored.**

**AI-assisted Work**:
- Use of AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Copilot) is **not forbidden** and may support learning  
- However, any deliverable or contribution created with AI assistance must be:
  - **explicitly acknowledged** (e.g. ‚Äúfragment generated with ChatGPT, adapted by me‚Äù);  
  - **reviewed and tested** by the student to ensure correctness and understanding.  
- Submitting fully AI-generated work without attribution or comprehension goes against the academic principles of this lab.

## Changelog
We maintain a [CHANGELOG.md](changelog.md) documenting major updates:  
- Major new labs (e.g., **Generative AI, Federated Learning, Graph AI**) are tagged as `new`.  

---

## GDPR & Data Policy
- All labs use **publicly available datasets** (e.g., TCGA, GEO, NCBI).  
- No student uploads of personal or clinical data are permitted.  
- When working with synthetic datasets (e.g., federated learning demos), files are clearly labeled as **synthetic**.
- 
See [docs/GDPR_and_DataPolicy.md](GDPR_and_DataPolicy.md) for details.

## GA4GH Primer
This lab aligns with the **Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)** standards for data ethics and interoperability.  

Students are introduced to:
- The importance of data sharing frameworks.  
- Ethical issues around patient privacy.  
- Interoperability across platforms using open standards.  

See [docs/GA4GH_primer.md](GA4GH_primer.md) for details.

## üìà Sustainability & Continuity
- Best student projects may be merged into this repository.  
- Annual updates ensure labs remain aligned with industry and research practice.  
- The BIOINF-Y4 Lab is connected with **Oncohelp clinical collaborations** and may directly support MSc dissertations and PhD research.
- Python license inventory: see [LICENSES-THIRD-PARTY.md](LICENSES-THIRD-PARTY.md).
